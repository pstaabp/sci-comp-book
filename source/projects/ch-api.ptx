  <title>Working with a web API and JSON strings</title>

  <p>
    This chapter will shown how to interact with a web API, a common way of getting data from a webserver in a way that can be more easily processed than with a HTML page. We first start with what a JSON string is and how to parse it, recall some basics of dictionaries from <xref ref="sect-dictionaries"/> and then make API calls using some network tools in Julia.
