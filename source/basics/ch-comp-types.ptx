	<title>Creating New Data Types in Julia</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Although there are many standard Julia data types that are useful for Scientific
			Computing, we can make new types called a composite data type.  We will start
			with developing a <c>PlayingCard</c> type that simplifies the poker hand
			simulations that we will see in <xref ref="ch-poker"/>.  We will also look
			at a <c>Polynomial</c> data type and finally create a <c>Root</c> type
			that will help with the rootfinding from <xref ref="ch-rootfinding"/>.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<section>
		<title>Basics of Julia's Composite Datatype</title>
		<p>
			The composite data type in Julia is called a <c>struct</c> and consists of
			some number of fields of an existing type.  A simple one is
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>struct Mystruct</cline>
			<cline>  num::Integer</cline>
			<cline>  str::String</cline>
			<cline>end</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			which has the two fields <c>num</c> and <c>str</c>. We are using the standard
			naming convention of a struct starting with a capital letter.  We can create an
			object<fn>Although a Julia struct is not an object in the sense of an object-oriented language,
			the terminology is pervasive in the Julia community.</fn> of type <c>Mystruct</c> by
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>m = Mystruct(13,"hello")</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			and we can access the fields of the struct with <c>m.num</c> and <c>m.str</c>.
			They will return <c>13</c> and <c>"hello"</c> respectively.
			Also, you can get an array of the names of the fields with <c>fieldnames(Mystruct)</c>.
			Note that the <c>fieldnames</c> command needs the datatype, not a variable of the datatype.
			This example is not very realistic, but the rest of the chapter will include more-practical examples.
		</p>

		<p>
			One cannot change the fields of a <c>struct</c>.  If <c>m</c> is defined as above and you try
			<c>m.str = "goodbye"</c>, then Julia will report the error:
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>setfield!: immutable struct of type Mystruct cannot be changed</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is exactly like trying to redefine a <c>const</c>.  As we will see
			most of the examples in this text are these constant types of <c>struct</c>s,
			you can make non-constant <c>structs</c> using the <c>mutable</c> keyword.
			For example:
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>mutable struct MutableStruct</cline>
			<cline>  a::Float64</cline>
			<cline>  b::Integer</cline>
			<cline>end</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			and then define an object such as
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>s=MutableStruct(1,2)</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			Then the redefinition <c>s.a=4.5</c> is allowed.  Note: that if you try to
			do <c>s.b=7.1</c>, the you will get the error:
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>InexactError: Int64(7.1)</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			which happens because you are trying to assign the value 7.1 to an integer, since the
			field <c>b</c> is an integer.
		</p>

		<title>A Card datatype</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In <xref ref="ch-poker"/>, we will use simulations to determine the probabilities of certain poker hands.
				Although the calculations can be done with built-in types, the result would be difficult to read and
				hard to understand.  Here, we will create a <c>Card</c> datatype that will help clarify the code
				by creating a type with a rank (1 to 13 corresponding to Ace, 2, through 10, Jack, Queen, King)
				and a suit (1 to 4 corresponding to the suits ``spades'', ``hearts'', ``diamonds'', ``clubs''),
				which we define as the characters arrays:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>ranks = ['A','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','T','J','Q','K']</cline>
				<cline>suits = ['\u2660','\u2661','\u2662','\u2663']</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				where the suits are the unicode characters<fn>See
				<url href="http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/unicode-input/" visual="julialang.org">the julia
				documentation on unicode</url>.</fn> for the suits.
				(Note: <c>ranks</c> and <c>suits</c> are arrays of characters (not strings). This is because
				they use single quotes.).  The following datatype:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>struct Card</cline>
				<cline>  rank::Integer</cline>
				<cline>  suit::Integer</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				will be used to store a <c>Card</c>.  Note that the suits and ranks are each integers,
				where we uses the suits 1, 2, 3, and 4 (which will corresponds to the actual suits)
				and the ranks will be the integers 1 to 13.
			</p>

			<p>
				To create a <c>Card</c>, just call the struct like a function with the given rank and
				suit, like <c>c = Card(3,2)</c>, which will create a card of rank 3
				and suit 2 (hearts). To access the fields of the type, we use dot notation.
				For example <c>c.rank</c> will return <c>3</c> and <c>c.suit</c> will return <c>2</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that the result of the card is <c>Card(3,2)</c>, which isn't very human
				friendly-I'd rather see the actual rank and suit.  Fortunately, a nice
				feature of Julia is to override the output using <c>Base.show</c>.  For example,
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>Base.show(io::IO, c::Card) = print(io, "$(ranks[c.rank])$(suits[c.suit])")</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				where the arguments of <c>Base.show</c> should be of type <c>IO</c> and then the datatype.
				The output from <c>Base.show</c> should call <c>print</c> as above. The result
				will be the concatenation of the characters corresponding to the rank and suit
				of the card.  Any of the forms in <xref ref="ch-variables"/> that do string
				concatentation will work, I'm a fan of string interpolation.
				Try this out by typing <c>c</c> and you should get <c>3♡</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: this is different than just a <c>print</c> or <c>println</c> within a
				function, which is highly discouraged. This function is called whenever a
				card type is displayed.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection>
			<title>Constructors of new data types</title>
			<p>
				When julia calls <c>Card(3,2)</c>, actually, it executes a special function
				called a constructor, which creates an instance of the type, which we have
				called an object. Although Julia creates the basic constructor--that is the
				one that fills the fields of the type in the order defined, we may want some
				additional features.  For example if we call <c>Card(-10,78)</c>, then julia returns
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>BoundsError: attempt to access 13-element Vector{Char} at index [-10]</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and we got the error because on <c>Base.show</c> we are trying to access an array
				outside of it's bounds.  We just told Julia to make a new data type with two integers
				and <c>Card(-10,78)</c> is the new data type with two integers.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can ensure that that the Cards only take the first argument as numbers
				between 1 and 13 and the second as between 1 and 4 by the updating the
				Card datatype as follows:
			</p>


			<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
				<input>
struct Card
  rank::Int
  suit::Int
  # construct a card based on the rank and suit
  function Card(r::Int,s::Int)
    1 &lt;= r &lt;=13  || throw(ArgumentError("The rank must be an integer between 1 and 13."))
    1 &lt;= s &lt;= 4  || throw(ArgumentError("The suit must be an integer between 1 and 4."))
    new(r,s)
  end
end
				</input>
			</program>

			<p>
				If you enter the above <c>struct</c> you should see the error:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>invalid redefinition of type Card</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				Recall, from the beginning of this chapter, this is because a <c>struct</c> is fixed,
				much like if a constant is declared and then it is redefined.  We want to
				replace the first <c>struct</c> with this one, so we will restart the kernel<fn>
				Recall, in Juypter, select <em>restart kernel</em> at the top and if you are
				using VS Code, the <em>restart</em> button will do the same.
				</fn>	You will need to reenter all of the needed cells,
				like the one with the ranks and suits as well as the one that starts
				<c>Base.show</c>.  In <xref ref="ch-modules"/>, we will put structs
				inside a module and not have to restart the kernel as you develop a new datatype.
			</p>

			<p>
				After restarting the kernel and rerunning the important cells, if we call
				<c>Card(-10,78)</c>, then we get
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>ArgumentError: The rank must be an integer between 1 and 13.</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				which is what we want and should notice that this error is what we said to do when
				the rank is not between 1 and 13.   Although we haven't covered handling errors yet,
				the <c>throw</c> function will send an error and we have the ability to
				catch and handle these errors gracefully if we want.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some other things to note about this new definition of <c>Card</c>
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							There are still two members of the struct, <c>rank</c> and <c>suit</c> listed
							on lines 2 and 3.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							There is a function defined on lines 5 through 9 now.  This is what is called
							when <c>Card</c> is called with two integers and is called a <term>constructor</term>.
							Line 6 checks if the rank (for this
							function is called <c>r</c>) is between 1 and 13 and similarly on line 7
							checks if the suits (called <c>s</c>) is between 1 and 4.  If either of these
							are outside the bounds an error is thrown.  We'll talk specifically about what
							<c>throw</c> does later in the text.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Inside the the contructor, line 8 is <c>new(r,s)</c>.  This assigns the
							member <c>rank</c> the value <c>r</c> and <c>suit</c> the value <c>s</c>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				We would also like another constructor that will take an integer between 1
				and 52 and returns the appropriate card. The following example will do this.
			</p>


			<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
				<input>
struct Card
  rank::Int
  suit::Int
  # construct a card based on the rank and suit
  function Card(r::Int,s::Int)
    1 &lt;= r &lt;=13  || throw(ArgumentError("The rank must be an integer between 1 and 13."))
    1 &lt;= s &lt;= 4  || throw(ArgumentError("The suit must be an integer between 1 and 4."))
    new(r,s)
  end
  # construct a card based on the number in a deck
  function Card(i::Int)
    1 &lt;= i &lt;= 52 || throw(ArgumentError("The argument must be an integer between 1 and 52"))
    mod(i,13)==0 ? new(13,div(i,13)) : new(mod(i,13),div(i,13)+1)
  end
end
				</input>
			</program>

			<p>
				And if you get the error that you cannot redefine <c>Card</c>, then again, restart
				the kernel.  The big difference with this definition is a second constructor
				function on lines 13-16 is another function with name <c>Card</c>.
				The important parts of this second constructor is
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Line 13 defines the input of the constructor.  The only input is a single
							integer.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Line 14 checks that the input <c>i</c> is between 1 and 52.  If not an error
							is thrown.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Line 15 defines the new <c>Card</c>. First, notice that there is a
							ternary <c>if-then-else</c>.  A check is made if <c>i mod 13</c> is zero.
							That is, 13, 26, 39 or 52.  If that is the case, set the rank to 13 (King)
							and the rank is i/13 (using <c>div</c> for integer division). Recall
							that <c>new</c> is used to set <c>rank</c> and <c>suit</c> of the struct.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							If <c>i mod 13</c> is not zero, then the rank is <c>mod(i,13)</c>.
							It will be an integer 1 through 12.  The suit is <c>div(i,13)+1</c>,
							which ensures that suit will be between 1 and 4.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<remark>
				<p>
					Notice that we have 3 different versions of the <c>Card</c> type. In the first
					version, only the members were defined.  There were no constructors.  Often, this
					is all that is needed for a type/struct, however, if you need to do some checking
					on arguments, then you will need to write a constructor or two.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you do use a constructor, define it as a function with the same name
					as the type (the case must be the same as well). The last line in contructor
					function must be the <c>new</c> function that fills the member fields in the
					same order as listed in the struct. See
					<url href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/constructors/\#man-constructors-1" visual="julialang.org">additional
					information about constructors in the Julia Documentation</url>
				</p>

		<subsection>
			<title>Creating a Hand datatype</title>
			<p>
				As we will see in <xref ref="ch-poker"/>, a hand is also helpful in playing
				card games, we will define a hand in the following way:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>struct Hand</cline>
				<cline>cards::Vector{Card}</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				which is just an array of cards. (Note: there is nothing here that
				specifies that the Hand has to be 5 cards, but that could be included by
				doing some error checking in the constructor).  An example hand would be
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>h1=Hand([Card(2,3),Card(12,1),Card(10,1),Card(10,4),Card(5,2)])</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and again, since this looks a bit ugly, we can define a <c>Base.show</c> method
				for a hand:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>Base.show(io::IO,h::Hand) = print(io, "[$(join(h.cards,", "))]")</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				Then let's define a card using the following:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>h1=Hand([Card(2,3),Card(12,1),Card(10,1),Card(10,4),Card(5,2)])</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				now <c>h1</c> should now return <c>[2♢, Q♠, T♠, T♣, 5♡]</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will return to this in <xref ref="ch-poker"/> where we will use this
				datatype to help with simulations.
			</p>

			<p>
				A note about the <c>Base.show</c> function for the <c>Hand</c>.  As will
				the <c>Base.show</c> for the <c>Card</c> type, the arguments are something of
				type <c>IO</c> and then something of type <c>Hand</c>. The function then
				calls <c>print</c> with the second argument a <c>String</c>.  The main part of
				this is the <c>join</c> command which takes an array of strings and joins
				(recall this from <xref ref="sect-join-split"/>)
				them separated by the second argument, <c>", "</c>. The rest of this just
				surrounds them by square brackets.
			</p>
		</subsection>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="sect-poly-parametric">
		<title>Polynomials: A parametric data type</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Recall that a polynomial is the sum of nonnegative powers of <m>x</m> with
				constant coefficients.  That is anything of the form:
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>
					P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				and we may want to solve problems with them and it may be helpful to have a
				data type of this form.  We can represent any polynomial by the coefficients.
				For example, the following will construct a datatype that is a polynomial with
				integer coefficients<fn>As well will see in <xref ref="ch-lin-alg-intro"/>,
				a <c>Vector</c> is shorthand or an alias for a 1D array</fn>:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>struct Polynomial</cline>
				<cline>coeffs::Vector{Int64}</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				We can then represent the polynomial <m>P(x) = 2-x+3x^2</m> with
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>p = Polynomial([2,-1,3])</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's say that we want to construct methods to add, subtract, multiply two
				polynomials and peform a scalar multiply as well. However, if we want to allow Polynomials with coefficients
				other than integer coefficients, such as rational or real or complex, then we
				would need to write a set of functions to do this for each datatype, which is 1)
				painfully dull, 2) hard to maintain since there are many copies of the same
				function and 3) unnecessary because Julia has a nice feature called a parametric type.
			</p>

			<p>
				We could define the Polynomial as
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>struct Polynomial{T}</cline>
				<cline>coeffs::Vector{T}</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				which has Polynomial that has a type <c>T</c>. This now allows with one
				definition to have a polynomial of integers, floats, complex and rationals.
				However, this would also allow us to define a polynomial of strings or <c>Card</c>s,
				which doesn't make any sense.  We can restrict the coefficients to number types with
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>struct Polynomial{T &lt;: Number}</cline>
				<cline>coeffs::Vector{T}</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				which defines the coefficients to be a <c>Vector</c> of type <c>T</c> and <c>T</c>
				from the first line is any subtype of <c>Number</c>, which is what the notation
				<c> &lt;: Number</c> means.  Recall that <xref ref="ch-data-types"/> explain
				the data typing system and how to determine subtypes of a type.  If a <c>struct</c>
				is created in a way like this to depend on a type, it is called a
				<term>parametric type</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, using the above definition of <c>Polynomial</c>, we can define the following
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>poly1=Polynomial([1, 2, 3])</cline>
				<cline>poly2=Polynomial([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])</cline>
				<cline>poly3=Polynomial([2//3, 3//4, 5//8])</cline>
				<cline>poly4=Polynomial([im, 2+0im, 3-2im, -im])</cline>
				<cline>poly5=Polynomial([n for n=1:6])</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and the result of the last will be <c>Polynomial{Int64}([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The beginning of the output, <c>Polynomial{Int64}</c> explains that it is a
				type polynomial.  The <c>Int64</c> within the <c>Polynomial</c> type explains
				what type the coefficients have.  If you enter the variable name, like <c>poly3</c>,
				then you will see the type of the coefficient (type <c>Rational{Int64}</c>)
				for that variable as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				It would be nice if the result looked like a polynomial. In this case,
				we can use the <c>Base.show</c> command.
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>function Base.show(io::IO, p::Polynomial)</cline>
				<cline>  print(io, reduce((str, n) -&gt; "$str $(n==1 ? "" : "+") $(p.coeffs[n]) x^$(n-1)", 1:length(p.coeffs),init=""))</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, if we reevaluate <c>poly5</c>, then Julia returns
				<c>1 x^0 + 2 x^1 + 3 x^2 + 4 x^3 + 5 x^4 + 6 x^5</c>.
				The <c>Base.show</c> command is complicated, so let's break this down a bit
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The first argument is of type <c>IO</c>.  Note that we also call the argument <c>io</c>.
							It doesn't matter what it is called, but we'll always use <c>io</c> in this book.
							The second argument is of type <c>Polynomial</c>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							The output as before is a <c>print</c> with first argument <c>io</c> and second
							argument a string using the <c>reduce</c> function.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Recall from section <xref ref="sect-reduce-array"/> that the <c>reduce</c> function takes
							an array and a function and returns a single value.  In this case, our array is the
							coefficients from the <c>Polynomial</c> which is accessed with <c>p.coeffs</c>.
							The function that creates the reduced string.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							The string consists of four parts, <c>$str</c> is the current value of the
							string.  This is basically string concatenation. <c>$(n==1) ? "" : "+")</c>
							puts a "+" in front of each coefficent and <c>$(p.coeffs[n])</c> is the
							coefficients and <c>x^$(n-1)</c> is the power of x.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							The array that is used for the <c>reduce</c> is the <c>UnitStep</c>
							<c>1:length(p.coeffs)</c> instead of the coefficients themselves.  This allows
							the powers of x to be generated.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							This isn't perfect.  For example, if there are negative coefficients,
							then you'll see a +- for a term.  This can be taken care of with
							another ternary <c>if-then-else</c>. Also, it would be nice to eliminate the <c>x^0</c>
							term (because it is just 1 as well as instead of writing <c>x^1</c> write <c>x</c>,
							but this is just a little icing.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Note that there are many other ways to write this <c>Base.show</c>
							for a polynomial.  One way would be to use a <c>for</c> loop to
							go through the polynomials.  I used a <c>reduce</c> to show another
							example of how to use this function in practical way.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection>
			<title>Adding Two Polynomials</title>
			<p>
				Another nice thing that we'd like to do is have an add command and use the symbol
				<c>+</c> for this.  However, if we enter <c>poly1+poly2</c>, then we get the error:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>MethodError: no method matching +(::Polynomial{Int64}, ::Polynomial{Float64})</cline>
				<cline>The function `+` exists, but no method is defined for this combination of argument types.</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				To create a function that adds two polynomials, we first need to do the following:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>import Base.+</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and then define how to add two polynomials with:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>function +(p1::Polynomial{T}, p2::Polynomial{S}) where {T &lt;: Number, S &lt;: Number}</cline>
				<cline>  Polynomial(p1.coeffs+p2.coeffs)</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>

				and then we can rerun the function <c>+</c> above.  This is now a function that
				adds two polynomials.  Note that the coefficients do not need to be the same type,
				so there are two types, <c>T</c> and <c>S</c> available. If we now enter
				<c>poly1+poly2</c>, the result is <c>2.0 x^0 + 4.0 x^1 + 6.0 x^2</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that this now a polynomial with floating point coefficients.

		<subsection>
			<title>Evaluating the polynomial</title>
			<p>
				Another helpful function is to actually evaluate the polynomial. The
				basic way to do this is to sum the terms of the polynomial.  A possible
				way to write this is using the reduce function that we saw in <xref ref="sect-reduce-array"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>function eval(poly::Polynomial{T}, x::Number) where T &lt;: Number</cline>
				<cline>  reduce((val,i) -&gt; val + poly.coeffs[i]*x^(i-1), 1:length(poly.coeffs))</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and now if we evaluate <c>poly1</c> when <c>x=-2</c>, we enter <c>eval(poly1,-2)</c>
				and get <c>9</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				An alternative to this is to use
				<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner\%27s_method" visual="wikipedia.org">
				Horner's form of the polynomial</url> that we saw in <xref ref="sect-horner"/>:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>function eval(poly::Polynomial{T}, x::Number) where T &lt;: Number</cline>
				<cline>  reduce((val,c) -&gt; x*val+c, reverse(poly.coeffs))</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>We have used <c>reduce</c> for each of these evalution methods. Let's dive into these
				a bit more
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The definition of the function is identical in both methods.  Recall that
							since <c>Polynomial</c> is a parametric type (that is, it has multiple subtypes)
							we need to specify the type with <c>T</c> and say that <c>T &lt;: Number</c>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the first eval method, the function is the terms themselves, <c>poly.coeffs[i]*x^(i-1)</c>
							and like the <c>Base.show</c> function above, the array used in <c>1:length(poly.coeffs)</c>
							not the coefficients.  This allows the use of the powers.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the section method (Horner's method), again we use <c>reduce</c> however
							is much simpler.  First, the innermost part of the method is
							<c>a_{n-1} + a_n * x</c>, and this is exactly the function used above, where
							<c>val</c> is the cumulative value going through the coefficients.
							Also, note that we needed to reverse the coefficient array because it's
							important that we go inside out--that is, the last coefficient is used first.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Reduce also has  <c>init</c> option that we didn't use here.  This is
							because initially these are both 0 and that is the default.  This differs
							from the <c>Base.show</c> above, in that initially we needed the empty
							string to start.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

		<title>Plotting the Polynomial</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				MOVE THIS SECTION
			</p>

			<p>
				Recall that using the <c>Plots</c> package, one can consider plotting the
				polynomial by creating a function that pulls out the coefficients.  However,
				the <c>Plots</c> package has a related package called <c>RecipesBase</c>
				that allows one to create a plotting recipe.  That is if <c>p</c> is a <c>Polynomial</c>,
				then we can write <c>plot(p)</c> and it will plot the polynomial.  Let's see
				how and don't forget to add the package and then enter <c>using RecipesBase</c>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The package <c>RecipesBase</c> includes the macro <c>@recipe</c> and
				although the documentation is sparse,
				<url href="https://github.com/JuliaPlots/RecipesBase.jl" visual="">this page</url>
				is helpful in the background.  The basic idea on a plot recipe is to do the following:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>@recipe f(t::TheType,...)</cline>
				<cline>end</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				where <c>TheType</c> is any datatype (either built-in or user defined).  The recipe
				needs to return some number of vectors of points (depending on if it is 1D, 2D or a
				3D plot). A simple version of this for type  <c>Polynomial</c> is
			</p>


			<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
				<input>
@recipe function f(poly::Polynomial,xmin::Number=-2,xmax::Number=2)
  xpts = LinRange(xmin,xmax,200)
  ypts = map(x-&gt;eval(poly,x),xpts)
  xpts,ypts
end
				</input>
			</program>

			<p>
				where line 2 creates an array of x values of length 200, then line 3 creates
				the y values for each x value.  Line 4 returns a tuple of the pairs of points.
				We can now use this to plot a polynomial and we will need to <c>using Plots</c> to:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>plot(poly1)</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				and since we defaulted the plot range from -2 to 2, we get the following plot:
				\begin{center}
				\pgfplotsset{scale=0.6}
				\plot{plots/comp-type/plot01.tex}{poly}
				\end{center}
			</p>

			<p>
				and if we want to specify the plotting range:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				plot(poly1,0,4)
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				we get
				\begin{center}
				\pgfplotsset{scale=0.6}
				\plot{plots/comp-type/plot02.tex}{poly}
				\end{center}
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection>
			<title>Changing other parameters</title>
			<p>
				But wait... There's more... One of the fantastic things about using <c>RecipesBase</c>
				is that we can still use all of the other parameters associated
				with plot as we normally would. For example:
			</p>

			<p>
				<cd>
				<cline>plot(poly1,0,4,linecolor=:orange,title="A quadratic", lw=2, legend=false)</cline>
				</cd>
			</p>

			<p>
				produces the plot:
				%
				\begin{center}
				\pgfplotsset{scale=0.5}
				\plot{plots/comp-type/plot03.tex}{poly}
				\end{center}
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<title>Setting Default parameters</title>
			<p>
				Recipes also allow to set default parameters. Let's say that if we want
				to always plot a polynomial green without a legend that we can put these
				default parameters in the recipe:
			</p>


			<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
				<input>
@recipe function f(poly::Polynomial,xmin::Number=-2,xmax::Number=2)
  legend --> false
  linecolor --> :green
  xpts = LinRange(xmin,xmax,200)
  ypts = map(x-&gt;eval(poly,x),xpts)
  xpts,ypts
end
				</input>
			</program>

			<p>
				If we have this definition then <c>plot(poly1,0,4)</c> produces the following plot:
				\begin{center}
				\pgfplotsset{scale=0.5}
				\plot{plots/comp-type/plot04.tex}{poly}
				\end{center}
			</p>

		<title>A Rootfinding datatype</title>
		<p>
			The last example of a new data type will be related to finding the root of a function.
			We explored this in <xref ref="ch-rootfinding"/>.  One major issue with that function
			is that if Newton's method did not find the root, it wasn't clear if it was a root
			or just that the algorithm stopped because it reached 10 steps.  There was no way that you (the user)
			knew which case occurred.  We will use a <c>struct</c> to store the information about
			the rootfinding in this section which then conveys what happens.
		</p>

		<p>
			In <xref ref="sect-newton"/>, we developed the following function for solving Newton's method:
		</p>


		<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
			<input>
using ForwardDiff
function newton(f::Function, x0::Number)
  local dx = 1
  local x1 = x0
  local steps = 0
  while abs(dx) &gt; 1e-6 &amp;&amp; steps &lt; 10
    dx = f(x1)/ForwardDiff.derivative(f,x1)
    x1 -= dx
    steps += 1
  end
  x1
end
			</input>
		</program>

		<p>
			Although if the function has a root and the method converges to it, then
			this method will probably find it, however, just running it, we don't know
			if it has exceeded the total number of steps (hardcoded as 10 steps in this example)
			or reached the root.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are going to define a <c>struct</c> to deliver more information as follows:
		</p>


		<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
			<input>
struct Root
  root::Float64    #  approximate value of the root
  x_eps::Float64   #  estimate of the error in the x variable
  f_eps::Float64   #  function value at the root f(root)
  num_steps::Int   #  number of steps the method used
  converged::Bool  #  whether or not the stopping criterion was reached
  max_steps::Int   #  the maximum number of steps allowed
end
			</input>
		</program>

		<p>
			and then return an object of type <c>Root</c>.  Thus we will replace the
			function <c>newton</c> above with
		</p>


		<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
			<input>
function newton(f::Function, x0::Number)
  local dx = 1
  local x1 = x0
  local steps = 0
  while abs(dx) &gt; 1e-6 &amp;&amp; steps &lt; 10
    dx = f(x1)/ForwardDiff.derivative(f,x1)
    x1 -= dx
    steps += 1
  end
  Root(x1, dx, f(x1), steps, steps &lt; 10, 10)
end
			</input>
		</program>

		<p>
			and note that we store extra information that is returned.  Let's run Newton's method
			on <m>f(x)=x^2-2</m> as an example by evaluating
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			newton(x-&gt;x^2-2,1)
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			returns <c>Root(1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 0, true, 10)</c>,
			which again gives a lot of information, but perhaps not very easy to read since
			you would need to know each of the fields and what each means.  We could then create a <c>Base.show</c>
			function to help with readability:
		</p>


		<program language="julia" line-numbers="yes">
			<input>
function Base.show(io::IO,r::Root)
  str = r.converged ? """The root is approximately x̂ = $(r.root)
    An estimate for the error is $(r.x_eps)
    with f(x̂) = $(r.f_eps)
    which took $(r.num_steps) steps""" :
    """The root was not found within $(r.max_steps) steps.
    Currently, the root is approximately x̂ = $(r.root).
    An estimate for the error is $(r.x_eps)
    with f(x̂) = $(r.f_eps)."""
  print(io,str)
end
			</input>
		</program>

		<p>
			which will print out different information if it converges or not.  Notice also that we
			have used the string interpolation <c>$( )</c> explained in <xref ref="ch-variables"/>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we now run Newton's method on <m>f(x)=x^2-2</m> with <c>newton(x-&gt;x^2-2,1)</c>
			then we get:
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>
				<cline>The root is approximately x̂ = 1.4142135623730951</cline>
					<cline>An estimate for the error is 1.5947429102833119e-12</cline>
					<cline>with f(x̂) = 4.440892098500626e-16</cline>
					<cline>which took 5 steps</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			and then if we run it on a function that does not have a root. Recall in <xref ref="ch-rootfinding"/>,
			we ran Newton's method on <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m>.  Since <m>x^2</m> is nonnegative
			then the function <m>x^2+1</m> is positive and so never is zero.  If we enter
			<c>newton(x-&gt;x^2+1,1.1)</c> then the result is
		</p>

		<p>
			<cd>
			<cline>The root was not found within 10 steps.</cline>
			<cline>Currently, the root is approximately x̂ = 0.030421004027873844.</cline>
			<cline>An estimate for the error is 1.0004626117382218</cline>
			<cline>with f(x̂) = 1.0009254374860639.</cline>
			</cd>
		</p>

		<p>
			And now it's clear that Newton's method did not converge within 10 steps and there is
			information about the estimated root and it's error.
